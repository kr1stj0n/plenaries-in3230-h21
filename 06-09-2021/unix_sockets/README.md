# 1st ORAKEL (IN3230) - UNIX sockets

In this session, we're going to implement a client/server application
using UNIX sockets.


## Usage:

- Compile the program using 'make all' in the main directory.
- ./chat -s to run the server  and ./chat -c to connect as a
  client.
- Follow on-screen instructions
- Practise and implement new features.

Good luck! :-)
