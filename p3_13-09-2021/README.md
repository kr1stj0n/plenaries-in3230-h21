# 3rd plenary session: 13.09.2021 #

This plenary session was completely dedicated to RAW sockets and MIP-ARP
protocol. Through a simple example with a 3-node topology (A - B - C), we
covered the main functions that a node needs to call in order to:

- send a simple ARP request via a RAW socket
- send a ARP reply in response to a BROADCAST ARP request
- Walk through all the interfaces of a node and store their MAC addreses
- etc.

Enough with words and hands on the C code!  

Check the code [here](https://github.com/kr1stj0n/plenaries-in3230-h21/tree/main/p3_13-09-2021/greet_ur_neighbor) and feel free to adapt it for the Oblig.  

**NOTE:** These examples that we are coding in the plenaries are very simple.
Make sure to write clean and efficient code in C, with proper functions and
better comments.  

Good luck! :-)
