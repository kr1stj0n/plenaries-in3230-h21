# 1st plenary session: 30.08.2021 #

The three main topics of the first plenary session were the followings:

* Course prerequisites
* NREC cloud
* Minimal Interconnection Protocol

## Course prerequisites ##

In the first part of the session, we talked about some of the prerequisites of
the course, which can be summarized into the following:

* An introductory course on Operating Systems and Networks
* Basic C programming

The prerequisites listed above are not mandatory. However, if a student lacks
such skills, it is highly recommended to attend the plenaries/group sessions
where we will cover the necessary concepts needed to solve the assignments.</br>

We continued with an interactive session of questions and answers in order for
the students to self-evaluate their skills. See the results [here](./menti_results.pdf).

## NREC cloud ##

The second session of the plenary was dedicated to the NREC cloud. We had a
step-by-step demonstration on launching a virtual machine in the cloud and
accessing it via SSH, following this [tutorial](https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/ifi/IN3230/h21/oblig/running-your-vm-on-nrec.html).

## Minimal Interconnection Protocol ##

Finally, we talked about MIP, a minimal network layer protocol that we will use
to build our simple network stack, as part of the course assignments. For more
dettails about MIP, read its specifications [here](https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/ifi/IN3230/h21/oblig/ispec-mip-2021-oblig.txt).

## Next plenary ##

In the next plenary session, we are planning to hand code client/server
applications that use UNIX and RAW sockets.
